Drupal module: D7 Field

Warning: This is experimental code under heavy development. Use at your own risk.

The D7 Field module provides support for easily writing additional fields in code, for which
extra fields and views fields are provided automatically. 

Classes use PSR-0 namespaces (Just like Drupal 8) and can implement many field hooks so no need
to define them in modules anymore.

See the d7field_example module for examples on how to implement your own fields.

This is an API module only for developers. See also https://github.com/josereyero/d7entity
